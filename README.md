# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Examples
This repository incorporates different simple CNN implementations into different datasets that can be found from Keras datasets. We applied CNN architectures using both Keras API (functional) and Sequential model to make readers understanding how to create a model by using Tensorflow Keras in different ways.
